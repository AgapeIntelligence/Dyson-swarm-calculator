# Dyson-swarm-calculator
Dyson Swarm Calculator: Open-source Python toolkit for engineering analysis of L1 sunshades – from 1.8% solar reduction (climate SRM) to full Dyson-swarm occlusion. Includes station-keeping, multi-layer reflector optimization, and scalability models with self-replicating industry timelines. Pure physics, order-of-magnitude trades.
